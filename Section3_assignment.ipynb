        "# Assignment 3: Ships in Satellite Imagery\n",
        "In this assignment we will build & train a classical object detector using the Histogram of Orientated Gradients (HOG) Descriptor. We will use this object detector to solve the problem of identifying ships in satellite imagery using the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/rhammell/ships-in-satellite-imagery.  This dataset consists of images of ships and images of NOT ships and is therefore a binary classification problem. The NOT ship categories include partial ships and also linear image features such as roads, jetties, etc., that may be confused with ships.   \n",
